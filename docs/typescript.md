# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type System
- Prefer types over interfaces for object definitions
- Use type for unions, intersections, and mapped types
- NEVER use `any` or `as any` types or coercion
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types
- Use generics for reusable type patterns

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for type names and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix interfaces for React props with 'Props' (e.g., ButtonProps)

## Code Organization
- Keep type definitions close to where they're used
- Export types and interfaces from dedicated type files when shared
- Do not use barrel exports (index.ts) for organizing exports
- Place shared types in a `types.ts` file
- Co-locate component props with their components
- Ensure there is no circular dependency between files

## Functions
- Use explicit return types for public functions
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and methods
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- Use function overloads for complex type scenarios
- Prefer async/await over Promises
- Prefer function expressions over function declarations.
- Prefer functional programming over classes.

## Best Practices
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Use readonly for immutable properties
- Leverage discriminated unions for type safety
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Implement proper null checking
- Avoid type assertions unless necessary

## Error Handling
- Do not proactively add error handling
- Handle Promise rejections properly
